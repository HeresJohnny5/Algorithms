// --- Directions
// You're given strings Jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and Stones representing the stones you have. 
// Each character in Stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
// The letters in Jewels are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in Jewels and Stones are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
// --- Examples:
//   jewelsAndStones('aA', 'aAAbbbb') === 3
//   jewelsAndStones('z', 'ZZ') === 0
